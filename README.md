# General idea
We at [@SchweizerischeBundesbahnen](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen) have a lot of projects who need changes on their projects all the time. As those settings are (and also should ;-)) limited to the administrator roles, we had to do a lot of manual changes like:
- Creating new projects with certain attributes
- Updating project quotas
- Creating service-accounts
- Update project billing information

So we built this tool which allows users to do certain things in self service. The tool checks permissions & certain conditions.
